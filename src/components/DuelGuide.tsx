          <p>
            Every turn, both champions secretly lock in a move, then the
            exchange resolves. <b>Speed decides who lands first</b> when both
            attack — and a champion that falls first never hits back.

              <b>⚔ Strike</b>
              <p>Your bread and butter. Builds the most Fury (+30, and +15 to whoever gets hit). Wins tempo against slower foes — but a guarded foe blocks 70% and counters.</p>
            </div>

              <b>🛡 Guard</b>
              <p>Blocks 70% of a strike and answers with a counter-blow. The right call when you predict a strike — but a <b>special crushes through guard</b> (only 25% blocked, no counter).</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Watch the foe’s Fury bar.</b> When it’s full, expect the special — never guard into it. Trade, or evade if your champion can.</li>
            <li><b>Both guard = standoff.</b> Nobody bleeds, both gain +20 Fury. Sometimes the patient play.</li>
            <li><b>Poison, burn and quills tick at the end of each exchange</b> — a stalling opponent still bleeds.</li>
            <li><b>Damage carries over.</b> Your winner keeps their wounds and Fury; the fresh challenger enters at full strength. Lead with fast, expendable chip fighters, hold your tank as the mid-battle anchor, and keep a fast closer for the end.</li>
            <li><b>A sacrifice can be strategy.</b> Feeding a wounded champion to a fresh enemy can drain them before your anchor walks in.</li>
